# Contributing

If you have a plugin that you want to appear on this list, please open a PR.  
We will review the plugin and give an opinion about it. If the opinion is
favorable then we will update your PR with our comment and merge it.

Your plugin MUST be high quality. We accept only plugins with a code quality
of 9.80 out of 10 and above.

Also it has to be:

- useful for developers or merchants
- documented enough
- available on Github, Bitbucket or Gitlab
- with working installation instructions
- under an opensource license
- enough tested, at least for major features

And the most important rule is that it has to follow the [Software Craftmanship approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship).

Also, you need to allow the edition of your PR from maintainers in
order to us to edit the comment in the README before merging.

⚠️ Your plugin has to continue following these rules. Otherwise it may be
removed from the curated plugins list.
